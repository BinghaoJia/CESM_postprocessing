## General rules for determining PE counts and distribution across nodes
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Averages:
##
## For avearges, set -N equal to the number of variables to be averaged 
## plus the number of averages to be computed. The ppn should always
## be set to 15 on cheyenne exclusive nodes. 
##
## For ocean hi-resolution or atm data sets with a lot of variables, 
## set the netcdf_format XML variable to netcdfLarge, change the queue to
## either geyser (shared) or bigmem (exclusive). For geyser, set -n to 16
## and ptile to 2 or more. Or, set -n < 16 and ptile to 1 which will 
## allow for more memory usage. The -W setting may also need to be 
## increased for large data sets.
##
##########
##
## Diagnostics:
##
## For diagnostics, the queue should always be set to geyser or caldera
## with the -n not to exceed the number of plot sets to be created. 
## The ptile can be adjusted depending on the size of the input climo
## and average files.
##
##########
##
## Variable Time series generation:
##
## On the cheyenne queues, -N should be set to total number of streams
## to be converted into variable timeseries * 16 minimum tasks per stream
## and ppn = 15. For geyser or caldera, the maximum -n is 16 and the 
## ppn can be adjusted based on what the memory requirements might
## be depending on the variable size and number of history time slices
## to be included in the final single variable output file.
