# CESM_postprocessing
Project repository for the CESM python based post-processing code, documentation via the wiki, and issues tracking.

The input data sets required by this code are separate from this repository. Instructions
for accessing these data sets will be coming soon. For NCAR users, the data sets are already
loaded into a central location on glade and do not need to be downloaded. 

The NCAR yellowstone quick start guide is available at:
